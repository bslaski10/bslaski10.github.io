                <p>According to college football personality Phil Steele, the Gamecocks have the nation’s toughest schedule based on opponents’ win percentages from 2022, and it really isn’t that close. The Gamecocks’ 2023 opponents won 66% of their games last season. The rest of the top-13 in strength of schedule have their opponents’ 2022 win percentages somewhere between 60% and 62.7%.</p>
